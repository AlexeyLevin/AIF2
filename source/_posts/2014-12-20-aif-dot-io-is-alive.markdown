## Long live aif.io!

Today, AIF community os proud to announce AIF web site: [aif.io](aif.io)

With this site, old [wiki](https://github.com/b0noI/AIF2/wiki) is deprecated and will not be maintained from very this moment. Each old wiki page has been updated with the link to new web site.

Big thanks to Evgeniy Dolgikh (Marcon) who was in charge of creating this site and porting all documentation from old wiki! This web-site will be impossible without his work!

In nearest plans to have:

* IRC channel
* forum

And of course we are about to release Alpha3, so stay touched
