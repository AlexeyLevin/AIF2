          The resource contains a selection of excerpts from BNC-Baby files that have been annotated for metaphor. There are four registers, each comprising about 50,000 words: academic texts, news texts, fiction, and conversations.
          Words have been separately labelled as participating in multi-word expressions (about 1.5%) or as discarded for metaphor analysis (0.02%).
          Main categories include words that are related to metaphor (MRW), words that signal metaphor (MFlag), and words that are not related to metaphor.
          For metaphor-related words, subdivisions have been made between clear cases of metaphor versus borderline cases (WIDLII, When In Doubt, Leave It In). 
          Another parameter of metaphor-related words makes a distinction between direct metaphor, indirect metaphor, and implicit metaphor.

          Metaphor is commonly seen as a deliberate figure of speech, a rhetorical device utilized to achieve aesthetic or rhetorical effects: its stereotypical manifestations are in literature and politics. Metaphor is therefore also generally regarded as a striking and deviant form of language use. This view, however, has been under fire since 1980, when Lakoff and Johnson published Metaphors we live by. Subsequent cognitive-linguistic research has emphasized that metaphor is normal and pervasive in language and its use. It even suggests that much of our general thinking is non-literal. As a result, metaphor has been recast as a figure of thought, and metaphor in language is analyzed as a natural reflection of metaphor in thought.
          The new approach has had a great impact on metaphor research in linguistics and psycholinguistics. One recent development has been the increased awareness that it is not entirely clear what counts as metaphor in language, language use, and cognitive processing. Followers of Lakoff and Johnson have mainly relied on clear cases out of context, but when metaphor is studied in authentic discourse, problematic questions about the identification of metaphor arise. These issues have been successfully addressed in this project.
          The programme creates a foundation in authentic discourse, including literature, education, journalism, politics, and business, for the investigation of many of the new findings about metaphor. This will redress the neglect of systematic attention to specific linguistic forms and their metaphorical meanings, their genre-related distribution and function, and the diverging depths of their cognitive representation in discourse processing.
